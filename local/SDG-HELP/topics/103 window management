> Window Management

Window Management is done primarily through your keyboard, with a couple of mouse options.


Within Mango, windows will automatically lay themselves out depending on your configured layout. you can tweak this layout at any time using *SUPER+SHIFT+W*.

the different layouts will be covered in 105 - layouts.


the following keybinds will help you with window management:

### general

[^SUPER+Q]: close window
quits the active window, works like pressing the x button on a desktop.


[^SUPER+T]: float/unfloat window
floated windows will appear above your tiled applications, and do not tile. 


[^SUPER+F]: toggle fullscreen
fullscreens the application, this puts the application in front of tiled and floating applications but behind overlay applications.


[^SUPER+ALT+F]: toggle fake fullscreen
tells the application it is fullscreen, but keeps the window tiled, this can be used to get rid of things top bars and window decoration. 


[^SUPER+SHIFT+P]: toggle overlay mode
overlay mode shows over top of everything regardless of whether it is tiled, floating or fullscreen. 


[^SUPER+P]: pin window
makes the window "global", meaning it will stay on your screen regardless of which workspace/tag you're on.

use again to remove. 

window *will* resize automatically if tiled, but will still be global if floated.


[^SUPER+A]: special layout toggle
this depends on your layout:
dwindle: maximizes the focused window, keeping it "windowed" but covering all other windows on the screen, making it appear as if it's the only tiled application.
scrolling: changes the scroller ratio for the focused window
grid layouts: toggles gaps
deck and master/stack (aka tile) layouts: swap the focused window with master.


[^ALT+TAB]: toggle and tab through overview
shows you all the windows on your current monitor, regardless of tab. hold down alt and press tab to cycle through, let go of alt to open the workspace/tag of the selected window.

you can also left click to open a window or right click to close it.


### workspace-related

[^SUPER+[1-9]]: switch to workspace
this moves all of your windows to showing this workspace/tag


[^SUPER+SHIFT+[1-9]]: move window to workspace
this will *only* switch the tag/workspace on currently active window, and will move the focused window to that tag/workspace


[^SUPER+ALT+[1-9]]: toggle a workspace
unlike in most other window managers, in mango, you can view multiple tags at once, using super+alt+numbers will toggle visibility of a tag/workspace.
this is independent per monitor. 


[^SUPER+SHIFT+A]: cycle through common layouts
this is configured in your config file using the circle_layouts config option (found in layouts.conf)
by default it switches as follows:
dwindle - scroller - vertical scroller - center tile - tile

### scratchpad

[^SUPER+CTRL+C]: move window to scratchpad
this minimizes the focused window to the scratchpad on that monitor. multiple windows can be stored in the scratchpad

[^SUPER+ALT+C]: move window out of scratchpad
this brings the last focused scratchpad window back out of the scratchpad on that monitor

[^SUPER+C]: open/close the scratchpad
views one of the windows in the current monitor's scratchpad. toggle this to cycle through.

[^SUPER+ALT+SPACE]: toggle terminal-specific scratchpad (quick-access terminal)
this is a special second scratchpad that will only ever contain a specially titled instance of ghostty. 
if this instance is not yet active, pressing the keybind will spawn one, if one exists but is not in the scratchpad, it'll be pulled into the scratchpad
if there *is* an instance in the terminal-specific scratchpad on that monitor, it'll show/hide that terminal. 

SDG-Os pre-loads one instance of ghostty to your main monitor's terminal scratchpad. 


### arrow keys

[^SUPER+ARROWS]: move focus
moves focus between windows using the keyboard

[^SUPER+SHIFT+LEFT/RIGHT]: focus previous/next
for some layouts where windows overlap eachother, this will allow you to go to the previously focused window. 

[^SUPER+SHIFT+UP/DOWN]: exchange stack clients (previous/next)
moves the window up and down the stack in all master/stack (tiled) layouts.

[^SUPER+CTRL+ARROWS]: resize window
resizes the window


### mouse binds
[^SUPER+LEFTCLICK-DRAG]: drag-and-drop window

this keybind allows you to drag windows around, you can grab a window anywhere. window will be temporarily floating while being dragged and will show where it'll tile to. 

if the window was already floating before being dragged, it will continue to float. 


[^SUPER+RIGHTCLICK-DRAG]: resize window

this keybind allows you to drag to resize a window, both tiled and floating. Do keep in mind you cannot resize a tiled window in a way that would cause the desktop to be visible.

for example, if you have two windows on a dwindle layout next to eachother, you can *only* resize them by moving the boundary between them left/right. 

[^SUPER+MIDDLECLICK]: maximize window

this keeps the window tiled, but allows it to use the full window, swallowing and hiding everything else on the monitor but keeping the top bar available.
