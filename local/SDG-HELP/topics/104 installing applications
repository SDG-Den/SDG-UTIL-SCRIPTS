### installing with Shelly

step 1: open Shelly
you can do this in multiple ways. either you can open shelly from your runner (*SUPER+SPACE* or from the button in the top bar)

step 2: set up Shelly (first launch only)
if this is your first time launching shelly, you'll need to tell shelly which repositories it should use.

pick at least pacman and the AUR, optionally also include flatpak.

step 3: select which repository you want to use
on the left, you'll have two or three tabs:
-pacman
-AUR
-flatpak

this is also the order in which you should use them.

use the pacman repository for all software, unless that software either is not available in pacman or the pacman version does not work.

if pacman does not have it, use the AUR, the AUR contains way more software but is less heavily moderated.

from the AUR, you can generally get multiple versions of the software, versions labeled -git are built from source, versions labeled -bin are a prebuilt binary

if neither have the program you want, flatpak is your last option. flatpaks are sandboxed and cross-platform, which means you'll find the same software across all distro's on flatpak. 

however, due to this sandboxing, there's sometimes permission issues with flatpak. you can alter permissions easily using *flatseal*


### installing with Unipkg TUI

to launch the unipkg tui, either press *super+shift+y* or run `unipkg launch-tui` in the terminal

from there, you can select install, and then your package manager of choice.

you'll then be presented with a searchable list of available packages alongside the information about the selected package.

you can multi-select here with *tab*, then press enter to install the selected software (this also installs what you have currently selected)


### installing with Unipkg cli 

for this, make sure your ~/.config/unipkg/unipkg.conf is in the right order (pacman - aur - flatpak)

you can do this by either running `micro ~/.config/unipkg/unipkg.conf` or by going to maintenance > edit unipkg.conf in the TUI.


then, to install anything, run `unipkg install any <packagename>`

this will attempt to install the package with all of your package managers in the order they are listed in unipkg.conf, stopping once it successfully finds and installs the package. 


### installing with Pacman Directly.

to install a piece of software directly, you can run `sudo pacman -S <package>`

this will install the package with pacman.


### installing from the AUR

SDG-OS comes with yay as its AUR helper, though you can also use paru.

simply run `yay -S <packagename>` to install a package from the AUR.
