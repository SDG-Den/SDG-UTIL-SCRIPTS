> basic navigation in the terminal


to help with navigation, SDG-OS comes pre-configured with eza, zoxide and fzf.

eza and zoxide replace your ls and cd commands respectively, fzf gives you access to fuzzy finding. 



when you spawn a terminal, you'll see something like this:

    ~ 

 this is prettified using powerlevel10k, and shows your *current* directory. 

 you can also get the current directory using the command `pwd` (print working directory)

 by default, this is your home directory, which as ~ as a shorthand.

 the longform is /home/yourusername.

 in guides, you may see /home/$(whoami) instead, this will replace $(whoami) with the output of the command "whoami" on run, which outputs your username.

 some scripts and commands won't like using ~, so you have to use the full path (for example, this is important when using the ln command to make symlinks)

 in this case, if you want your command to be username-agnostic, you can use $(whoami)


 to list files in the current directory, type `ls`

 this will use eza under the hood and give you a line-by-line output of files.


the lines will look something like this:
drwxr-xr-x     - den 24 may 23:57  test

here's what each thing means:
drwxr-xr-x - this is your permissions
- - this is not filled in here as the example is a directory, but will show the size in bytes.
den - this is the account that owns the file
24 mei 23:57 - this is the time/date the file was last modified
and lastly, the name. 


you may see something like this:
lrwxrwxrwx     - den 12 apr 05:04  .vscode -> /home/den/.vscode-oss

that means that this item is symlinked to /home/den/.vscode-oss



you can move into a directory using `cd <dirname>`

cd actually uses zoxide under the hood, which means that you actually also have fuzzy finding for directories you've visited before.


instead of filling in cd `/home/den/ownCloud/ArchConfig/MangoScripts` for example, i can just run `cd mangoscripts`, as it's the search match that i visit the most often.


cd also supports some special syntax, this can be used on its own or within a path:

~ - shorthand for /home/yourusername
. - shorthand for "current working directory", equal to the directory listed in your prompt. 
.. - one directory up from the current working directory
... - two directories up from the current directory
.... - three directories up from the current directory

normally, if you type `cd DirName`, it'll look for DirName in the current directory, which would be equal to `cd ./DirName`

from a fresh terminal, these will do the following:

`cd dir` - will move to /home/username/dir
`cd ~/dir` - will move to /home/username/dir regardless of current location
`cd ./dir` - will move /home/username/dir
`cd /dir` - will move to /dir
`cd ../dir` - will move to /home/dir
`cd ./dir/subdir` - will move to /home/username/dir/subdir
`cd sub` - will move to /home/username/dir/subdir if you've visited it before and it's the most common path you visit with "sub" in it.
