> layouts

the following layouts exist, most with multiple variants:

- dwindle
- scroller
- master/stack (called tile)
- monocle
- grid
- fair
- deck

this will also cover a bit more about the *overview* and *scratchpad*


## dwindle

dwindle uses a *binary space partitioning* system.

when you spawn a window, it'll split the currently focused window in half across the longest side.

if the window is wider than it is tall, it'll split vertically.

if the window is taller than it is wide, it'll split horizontally. 

in this mode, the special layout toggle *super+a* maximizes the focused window. 


## scroller

comes in horizontal and vertical variants.

windows are laid out in an infinitely scrollable strip of columns, you can vertically tile within this column.

in this mode, the special layout toggle *super+a* will change the width of the focused scrolling column between different presets.

you can scroll either with super+arrow keys or by moving your mouse over the windows that are partially outside of the window. 


## master/stack (tile)

comes in left, right, vertical and center variants.

these all have a primary window that uses 70% of the monitor and won't change size. all other windows will be tiled around it.

on the left and right variants, the windows will be tiled vertically to the side of the master window.

on the vertical variant, the windows will be tiled horizontally below the master window.

on the center variant, windows will be tiled alternating on the left and right of the master window.

in this mode, the special layout toggle *super+a* will swap the focused window with the master window. 

you can also drag and drop a window into the master area to make it the master, pushing the previous master to the top of the stack.


## grid
this is a simple grid setup that keeps all windows the same size. in horizontal grid it'll go left to right, then top to bottom. 

a vertical grid will go top to bottom, then left to right. 

in this mode, special layout toggle *super+a* will toggle the gaps and borders.


## fair

this is similar to grid, but fills your monitor as "fairly" as possible instead of just allowing empty space like grid.


## monocle

in monocle, you'll see one window at a time. you can cycle through them using *super+shift+left/right* or by using the overview.

the special layout toggle will not do anything in this mode.


## deck

deck is effectively a combination between monocle and master/stack. you'll have a master window and stack, but the stack acts like a monocle layout.

binds work the same, and in this layout, the special layout toggle *super+a* will make the focused window the master.


## overview

to enter the overview, either move your mouse to the top left corner (hot corner settings) or hold down alt while pressing tab.

this will bring you to the overview, showing you all windows on that monitor regardless of tag/workspace or layout. 

pressing tab allows you to cycle through, letting go of alt focuses the selected window, moving the workspace/tag on that monitor if needed. 

you can also left/right click while in this menu. left click to focus that window, right click to close.


## scratchpad

the scratchpad is effectively an extra hidden space you can store windows in, the core usecase is to store something you will need to frequently access but not for a long time, such as a notepad, music player, terminal or file browser.

pressing *super+c* will toggle visibility for the scratchpad, you'll only see one item in your scratchpad space at a time, by pressing *super+c* multiple times you can cycle through them. 

*super+ctrl+c* will move the focused window to that monitor's scratchpad. 

*super+alt+c* will move a window back out of the active monitor's scratchpad.


the scratchpad window will show up as a floating window over top of your other windows, and will be slightly smaller than your window, so you can drag-and-drop files from the scratchpad to your workspace.


SDG-OS also comes with a special scratchpad for a terminal, spawned with *super+alt+space*

this scratchpad has some special behaviour: the button will toggle visibility *if* there is a terminal with a specific title already inside it, if there isn't, it'll spawn a new terminal with a specific title or pick one up if a terminal exists with that title but isn't in the scratchpad.

this means that if the scratchpad is empty, you'll have to press the button combination twice: once to spawn it, and then again to put the terminal in the scratchpad.

a specific title is used as an identifier to avoid accidentally moving other terminals into this workspace. only terminals spawned by this keybind can be picked up by this keybind.


the autostart configuration includes pre-loading for the terminal scratchpad on your primary display.
